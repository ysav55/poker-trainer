## Open Issues

| ID | Sev | Description | Notes |
|----|-----|-------------|-------|
| ISS-77 | 🟡 | `hand_tags` unique constraint was `(hand_id, tag, tag_type)`. Migration 006 replaces it with three partial unique indexes for hand-level, player-level, and action-level tags. Old rows with the original constraint are not retroactively cleaned — duplicate rows could exist if the migration is applied to a DB with existing data. | Safe for new Supabase projects. If applying to an existing DB, run `DELETE FROM hand_tags WHERE ctid NOT IN (SELECT min(ctid) FROM hand_tags GROUP BY hand_id, tag, tag_type, player_id, action_id)` first. |
| ISS-73 | 🟡 | Replay hole cards may not show for hands recorded before the ISS-69 stableId fix (2026-03-16). Pre-fix hands stored `socket.id` as `player_id` in `hand_players`; the replay lookup keys on `stableId`, so they never match. New hands are unaffected. | Mitigation: re-play hands via load scenario instead. Full fix would require a DB migration to back-fill stableIds for old hands, which is low priority. |
| ~~ISS-75~~ | ~~🟡~~ | ~~Supabase anon read policies on all tables expose all hand/player data to any unauthenticated browser client.~~ | **RESOLVED 2026-03-19** — Anon key removed from browser entirely. All data access goes through Express (JWT-authenticated). Supabase RLS can now be simplified to service-role-only. |

| ID | Sev | Description | Fixed |
|----|-----|-------------|-------|
| ISS-98 | 🟠 | A crash inside `<PokerTable>` or `<CoachSidebar>` blanked the entire UI with no recovery path. Added `<ErrorBoundary>` wrappers in `App.jsx` with a reload/retry prompt and best-effort server-side logging to `/api/logs/client-error`. | 2026-03-29 |

## Resolved — v1.0 Hardening (2026-03-26)

| ID | Sev | Description | Fixed |
|----|-----|-------------|-------|
| ISS-78 | 🔴 | `AnalyzerService.buildAnalyzerContext` selected wrong column names (`starting_stack`, `final_stack`) from `hand_players`. Actual columns are `stack_start`/`stack_end`. Caused `SHORT_STACK`/`DEEP_STACK` tags to always compute against 0. | v1.0 hardening |
| ISS-79 | 🟠 | `/api/alpha-report` had no auth middleware — unauthenticated users could access system diagnostic reports. | v1.0 hardening |
| ISS-80 | 🟠 | 5 async socket handlers in `playlists.js` had no try-catch — a DB error would leave the client hanging with no error. | v1.0 hardening |
| ISS-81 | 🟠 | `replay.js` `replay_exit` and `handConfig.js` `load_hand_scenario` had no try-catch around async DB calls. | v1.0 hardening |
| ISS-82 | 🟡 | `leaveRoom` did not clear `poker_trainer_jwt` / `poker_trainer_player_id` from localStorage. A new user on the same browser inherited the previous session's credentials. | v1.0 hardening |
| ISS-83 | 🟡 | `endHand()` marked the hand complete before player stat updates. If player updates failed, the hand was marked complete with partial data. Fixed: run player updates first, mark hand complete only after. | v1.0 hardening |
| ISS-84 | 🟡 | `endHand()` used `Promise.all` for player updates — one failure aborted all. Replaced with `Promise.allSettled` to tolerate partial failures. | v1.0 hardening |
| ISS-85 | 🟡 | `recordDeal` and `markIncomplete` used `Promise.all` — switched to `Promise.allSettled` for partial-failure tolerance. | v1.0 hardening |
| ISS-86 | 🟡 | No `connect_error` handler on the Socket.io client. Expired JWT caused a silent stuck state with no feedback. Now clears credentials and logs the error. | v1.0 hardening |
| ISS-87 | 🟡 | `apiFetch` threw generic `Error` on 401, with no credential cleanup. Now clears localStorage and throws a typed error on 401. | v1.0 hardening |
| ISS-88 | 🟡 | `pendingBet` in `BettingControls` could get stuck if `gameState` object reference didn't change. Added a belt-and-suspenders `useEffect` keyed on `isMyTurn` to reset it. | v1.0 hardening |
| ISS-89 | 🟡 | `ReplayEngine.load()` accepted any truthy `handDetail` without checking `actions`/`players` arrays — garbage state on incomplete hands. Now validates before touching state. | v1.0 hardening |
| ISS-90 | 🟢 | `findLastAggressorIndex` in `tagAnalyzers/util.js` only matched `raise`/`bet` — all-in aggression was invisible to `BLUFF_CATCH`/`HERO_CALL` tags. Added `all-in` to the match set. | v1.0 hardening |
| ISS-91 | 🟡 | `compareHands()` in `HandEvaluator` would throw on malformed hand results (`bestFive` undefined). Added null guard. | v1.0 hardening |
| ISS-92 | 🟡 | `place_bet` handler accepted arbitrary action strings and non-integer raise amounts from the client. Now validates action enum and raise amount before processing. | v1.0 hardening |
| ISS-93 | 🟡 | Coach control handlers (`set_blind_levels`, `adjust_stack`, `set_player_in_hand`, `award_pot`) had no input type validation. Now validated before forwarding to game engine. | v1.0 hardening |
| ISS-94 | 🟠 | Dealer rotation used array index arithmetic (`dealer_seat + 1) % numPlayers`) — seat and index conflated. When players had non-sequential seats or a player was removed, the button jumped to the wrong player. Fixed to find dealer by seat, advance by iterating eligible players sorted by seat. | v1.0 hardening |
| ISS-95 | 🟢 | `addHandToPlaylist` had no guard on missing args — silent DB failure. Added explicit validation. | v1.0 hardening |
| ISS-96 | 🟠 | `sessions.js` error handler interpolated `err.message` into raw HTML (`<pre>Report error: ${err.message}</pre>`), creating a reflected XSS vector. Fixed to return `{ error: 'report_failed' }` JSON. | v1.0 hardening |
| ISS-97 | 🟡 | All 5 route files returned `{ error: err.message }` in catch blocks, leaking internal error details to clients. Now return `{ error: 'internal_error' }` uniformly. | v1.0 hardening |

| ISS-10 | 🟠 | BettingControls prop mismatch | Epic 9 |
| ISS-12 | 🟡 | `forceNextStreet()` + `_advanceStreet()` each called `_saveSnapshot('street')` — double snapshot per forced advance | Epic 16 |
| ISS-13 | 🟡 | Same root cause as ISS-12 — rolling back after forced advance restored an intermediate state | Epic 16 |
| ISS-14 | 🟡 | `_resolveShowdown()` side-pot path: `handMap[p.id]` could be `undefined` for non-active eligible player IDs | Epic 16 |

| ISS-17 | 🟠 | Socket connected to wrong port (8001 instead of 3001) | Epic 7 |

| ISS-23 | 🟠 | Winner name lookup broken in PokerTable | Epic 7 |
| ISS-24 | 🟡 | `mainPot` in `PokerTable.jsx` — dead code, logically incorrect | Epic 16 |

| ISS-29 | 🟢 | `open_config_phase` handler didn't check `result.error` | Epic 16 |
| ISS-31 | 🟢 | `canRaise` used redundant `> \|\| >=` logic | Epic 16 |
| ISS-32 | 🟢 | `PlayerSeat.jsx` checked non-existent `player.is_folded` field | Epic 16 |
| ISS-41 | 🟡 | Ghost player seat showed as "Occupied" with no UI indicator during 60 s TTL | Epic 14 |
| ISS-51 | 🟡 | WALK detection false positive: BB is always posted but was counted as a raise | Epic 16 |
| ISS-52 | 🟡 | `load_hand_scenario` silently dropped extra hole cards when player count mismatched | Epic 16 |
| ISS-53 | 🟡 | Playlist auto-advance silently skipped hands deleted from DB | Epic 16 |
| ISS-54 | 🟡 | `_saveSnapshot()` stripped `playlist_mode.hands`, losing playlist state after undo | Epic 16 |
| ISS-61 | 🟡 | Live Hand Tags were local-only; lost on page refresh | Epic 16 |
| ISS-62 | 🟡 | `coachDisconnected` flag cleared on `connect` event instead of `game_state` — overlay could clear prematurely | Epic 14 |
| ISS-63 | 🟡 | Catch-all `app.get('*')` returned `index.html` for non-existent API routes instead of 404 JSON | Epic 16 |
| ISS-66 | 🔴 | `player_id` in DB was ephemeral `socket.id` — same student treated as new entity on every reconnect | Epic 11 |
| GAP-2  | 🟠 | VPIP/PFR saved from player's last action (e.g. river fold) instead of preflop action — stats were wrong | DB fix 2026-03-15 |
| GAP-3  | 🟡 | WTSD/WSD never persisted to DB; career stats couldn't show these metrics | DB fix 2026-03-15 |
| GAP-4  | 🟢 | `mistake_tags` saved but never returned in any query response | DB fix 2026-03-15 |
| GAP-5  | 🟡 | No index on `hand_players.player_id` — full table scan on every player history load | DB fix 2026-03-15 |
| GAP-6  | 🟢 | `display_name` set at registration but never synced after name changes | DB fix 2026-03-15 |
| GAP-7  | 🟡 | WHALE_POT tag hardcoded `bb=20` — wrong for tables with different blind levels | DB fix 2026-03-15 |
| ISS-50 | 🟡 | `analyzeAndTagHand` included reverted actions — false-positive pattern detection after Undo | Fixed 2026-03-15 (filter `is_reverted=1` already implemented in extended analyzer) |
| WF-01 | 🟡 | `GameManager.js` `replay_mode` not reset in `resetForNextHand()` — `branched=true` persisted across hands, permanently blocking future `branchFromReplay()` calls | Fixed 2026-03-15 |
| WF-02 | 🟠 | `GameManager.js` `_saveSnapshot()` captured `pre_branch_snapshot` (full deep copy) inside history entries — exponential memory growth across undo stack | Fixed 2026-03-15 (strip `pre_branch_snapshot: null` in snapshot, same pattern as `playlist_mode.hands`) |
| WF-03 | 🔴 | `GameManager.js` `startGame()` lacked phase guard — callable during `phase='replay'`, would destroy replay state and deal a new hand mid-replay | Fixed 2026-03-15 |
| WF-06 | 🟡 | `GameManager.js` `branchFromReplay()` did not reset `current_turn = null` — branched state started with stale `current_turn` from replayed hand | Fixed 2026-03-15 |
| WF-10 | 🟡 | `server/index.js` `load_replay` handler did not block when `playlist_mode.active` — loading a replay while a playlist was active corrupted playlist state | Fixed 2026-03-15 |
| DB-02 | 🔴 | `server/index.js` `bigBlind` never passed to `HandLogger.startHand()` — all hands stored with `big_blind=0`; `WHALE_POT` tag (threshold `150 × big_blind`) never fired | Fixed 2026-03-15 |
| DB-06 | 🟡 | `server/index.js` `analyzeAndTagHand` errors swallowed silently — tagging failures were invisible in logs, making diagnosis impossible | Fixed 2026-03-15 (console.error added) |
| EC-01 | 🔴 | `server/reports/SessionReport.js` Player names interpolated raw into HTML — stored XSS via crafted display name. Missing CSP header on report endpoint. | Fixed 2026-03-15 (`esc()` helper + CSP header) |
| EC-09 | 🟡 | `server/index.js` `pausedTimerRemainders` not deleted on `reset_hand` — paused timer remainder from previous hand bled into next hand's action timer duration | Fixed 2026-03-15 |
| EC-22 | 🟠 | `server/index.js` Action timer callback only checked `state.paused` before auto-folding — if phase changed to `showdown`/`waiting` after timer started, auto-fold still executed on wrong phase | Fixed 2026-03-15 (check `phase` + `current_turn` before acting) |
| FE-07 | 🔴 | `client/src/App.jsx` All 7 replay emit helpers (`loadReplay`, `replayStepFwd`, etc.) implemented in `useSocket.js` but never added to the `emit` bundle — buttons silently did nothing | Fixed 2026-03-15 |
| SIM-01 | 🔴 | `GameManager.js` `_advanceStreet()` did not set `current_turn = null` when all remaining active players are all-in — stale `current_turn` pointed to a player with `is_active=false` (the last folder), causing subsequent `place_bet` calls to return `Invalid player state` and hang the game | Fixed 2026-03-15 (add `this.state.current_turn = null` at end of all-in loop) |
| FE-10 | 🔴 | `client/src/components/BoardCards.jsx` `getRevealedSlots()` had no case for `'replay'` phase — fell through to `default: return []`, making all board cards invisible during replay | Fixed 2026-03-15 |
| FE-11 | 🟡 | `client/src/components/PokerTable.jsx` Phase label rendered "replay" in gold text alongside the REPLAY badge — duplicate conflicting indicators | Fixed 2026-03-15 (exclude `replay` from phase label condition) |
| EC-23 | 🔴 | `server/index.js` `set_mode` handler had no phase guard — callable mid-hand, corrupting betting state machine. Added `ACTIVE_PHASES` guard that rejects with `sync_error` when phase is not `waiting`/`config`. | Fixed 2026-03-15 |
| EC-24 | 🟠 | `server/index.js` Game-logic rejections used hard `error` event instead of soft `sync_error`. Added `sendSyncError()` helper; replaced all game-state-rejection `sendError()` calls in `undo_action`, `rollback_street`, `award_pot`, `start_configured_hand`, all replay handlers. | Fixed 2026-03-15 |
| EC-25 | 🟠 | `server/index.js` `start_configured_hand` called `gm.startGame()` without checking `config_phase` — callable at any time. Added `if (!gm.state.config_phase)` guard. | Fixed 2026-03-15 |
| EC-26 | 🟠 | `server/index.js` `undo_action` allowed during `phase='waiting'` — popped previous hand's history, corrupting phase to `preflop` with no deal. Added `phase === 'waiting'` guard. | Fixed 2026-03-15 |
| WF-05 | 🟡 | `server/index.js` `open_config_phase` callable during `phase='replay'`, corrupting replay state. Added `phase === 'replay'` guard. | Fixed 2026-03-15 |
| WF-11 | 🟠 | `server/index.js` `rollback_street` error path returned without broadcasting state, leaving client hung. Now calls `broadcastState()` before returning on failure. | Fixed 2026-03-15 |
| ISS-69 | 🔴 | `SessionManager.js` `addPlayer()` signature was `(socketId, name, isCoach)` — the `stableId` 4th param was never forwarded to `GameManager.addPlayer()`. All non-coach players got `socket.id` as their stableId, silently breaking `hole_cards_range` and `hole_cards_combos` lookups in HandGenerator. Found via B126 batch anomalies. | Fixed 2026-03-16 |
| ISS-70 | 🟠 | `CoachSidebar.jsx` used uppercase `'WAITING'` phase comparisons against a lowercase `'waiting'` value from the server — Configure Hand button never rendered, HandConfigPanel never shown. | Fixed 2026-03-16 (normalize with `.toUpperCase()`) |
| ISS-71 | 🔴 | `GameManager.js` `generatorConfig` only forwarded `mode`, `holeCards`, `board` — silently dropped `hole_cards_range`, `hole_cards_combos`, `board_texture`. Range/texture/combos features never fired end-to-end. | Fixed 2026-03-16 |
| DB-01 | 🟠 | `SessionManager.js` WTSD counted all `is_active` players at showdown — including players who only survived because the flag wasn't cleared. Now uses `showdown_result.allHands[]` membership instead. | Fixed 2026-03-16 |
| DB-03 | 🟡 | `Database.js` No UNIQUE constraint on `display_name` — duplicate names could corrupt coach UI and stat joins. Added partial case-insensitive UNIQUE index `WHERE display_name IS NOT NULL`. | Fixed 2026-03-16 |
| DB-04 | 🟠 | `server/index.js` A new socket could claim a coach seat by sending `isCoach: true` without being in the `players.csv` roster with `role: coach`. Replaced `COACH_PASSWORD` env-var check with `PlayerRoster.getRole(name) !== 'coach'` guard in `join_room`. | Fixed 2026-03-17 |
| DB-07 | 🟡 | `SessionManager.js` Session IDs used `Date.now()` — millisecond collisions possible. Replaced with `uuidv4()`. | Fixed 2026-03-16 |
| DB-09 | 🟡 | `server/index.js` Coach stableId fell back to `socket.id`, breaking career stat joins on reconnect. Now uses deterministic `coach_${tableId}`. | Fixed 2026-03-16 |
| EC-03 | 🟠 | `server/index.js` `tables` Map grew unboundedly. Now pruned in the TTL expiry callback when no sockets remain in the room. | Fixed 2026-03-16 |
| WF-07 | 🟡 | `server/index.js` `_loadScenarioIntoConfig()` ignored error returns from `openConfigPhase()`/`updateHandConfig()`. Now checks and propagates errors; callers emit notifications. | Fixed 2026-03-16 |
| ISS-06 | 🟢 | `SidePotCalculator.js` Undocumented `is_active`/`is_all_in` contract. Added explanatory comment. | Fixed 2026-03-16 (comment only) |
| ISS-25 | 🟡 | `SessionManager.js` Same root cause as DB-01 — resolved by the DB-01 fix. | Fixed 2026-03-16 |
| ISS-26 | 🟢 | `HandEvaluator.js` Full House `kickers` semantics undocumented. Added comment. | Fixed 2026-03-16 (comment only) |
| ISS-27 | 🟢 | `HandEvaluator.js` `evaluateShort()` flush/straight omission undocumented. Added comment. | Fixed 2026-03-16 (comment only) |
| ISS-30 | 🟢 | `HandConfigPanel.jsx` Start Hand button stuck for 3 s on server error. Now resets via `useEffect` on `gameState` change instead. | Fixed 2026-03-16 |
| ISS-33 | 🟢 | `GameManager.js` `notifications: []` dead state field — field was already removed in a prior session. Non-issue. | Closed 2026-03-16 (field absent) |
| ISS-40 | 🟡 | `server/index.js` Timer/pause race undocumented. Added detailed comment explaining the ordering guarantee. | Fixed 2026-03-16 (comment only) |
| ISS-55 | 🟢 | `Database.js` CASCADE DELETE pragma dependency undocumented. Added comment. | Fixed 2026-03-16 (comment only) |
| ISS-56 | 🟢 | `HandLogger.js` `removeHandFromPlaylist` transaction assumption undocumented. Added comment. | Fixed 2026-03-16 (comment only) |
| ISS-57 | 🟢 | `server/index.js` `activate_playlist` guard concern — `config_phase=true` still has `phase='waiting'` so guard already allows it. Added comment confirming the non-issue. | Fixed 2026-03-16 (comment only) |
| ISS-58 | 🟢 | `server/index.js` `adjustStack` assumption for `stackMode=historical`. Added comment. | Fixed 2026-03-16 (comment only) |
| ISS-59 | 🟢 | `PokerTable.jsx` Hardcoded `9` modulo in POV rotation. Replaced with `SEAT_POSITIONS.length`. | Fixed 2026-03-16 |
| ISS-60 | 🟢 | `BettingControls.jsx` `pendingBet` shallow-equal edge case. Added comment. | Fixed 2026-03-16 (comment only) |
| ISS-64 | 🟢 | `Dockerfile` Pre-compiled binary assumption undocumented. Added comment. | Fixed 2026-03-16 (comment only) |
| ISS-65 | 🟢 | `Database.js` No `mkdirSync` guard for custom `DATABASE_PATH`. Added guard. | Fixed 2026-03-16 |
| ISS-67 | 🟢 | `HandLogger.js` OPEN_LIMP fires when `bbPlayerId` is null, producing false positives. Added null guard. | Fixed 2026-03-16 |
| ISS-68 | 🟢 | `HandConfigPanel.jsx` `rangeDebounceRefs` not cleaned up on unmount. Added `useEffect` cleanup. | Fixed 2026-03-16 |
| FEAT-01 | 🟢 | No coach control over blind levels — table always ran 5/10. Added `set_blind_levels` socket event + CoachSidebar Section 4 UI. | Added 2026-03-16 |
| FEAT-02 | 🟢 | Default starting stack hardcoded (1000) — not scaled to blinds. Now computed as `100 × BB` dynamically. | Added 2026-03-16 |
| FEAT-03 | 🟢 | `small_blind` never stored in DB — `hands` table only had `big_blind`. Added migration + HandLogger support. | Added 2026-03-16 |
| FEAT-04 | 🟢 | No per-player BB view mode. Added `fmtChips(amount, bigBlind, bbView)` utility and Chips/BB toggle button on table. | Added 2026-03-16 |
| SIM-02 | 🟢 | `simulate_batches.js` crashed on batch 2+ because `upsertPlayerIdentity` set `display_name = last_known_name` for coaches — each batch's coach stableId (`coach_${tableId}`) is unique, causing a duplicate `display_name='Coach'` violation on the partial UNIQUE index. Fixed by removing `display_name` from `upsertPlayerIdentity`; only `registerPlayer` (auth registration) sets `display_name`. | Fixed 2026-03-16 |
| WF-12 | 🟢 | `GameManager.js` `openConfigPhase()` had no guard for active hand phases — callable during `preflop`/`flop`/`turn`/`river`/`showdown`, overwriting live config state. Added `activePhases` guard returning `{ error }`. Server handler changed from `sendError` to `sendSyncError` for consistency. Found via B211 batch test. | Fixed 2026-03-16 |
| SIM-03 | 🟢 | `simulate_batches.js` B145–B244 (100 new batches) added covering: action order, fold-win fix, coach seat, HU rules, chip conservation, REST API, dealer rotation, min-raise, all-in, undo/rollback, in-hand toggle, pause, config guards, replay edge cases, auth guards, player invariants, manual config, auth edge cases, regression. | Added 2026-03-16 |
| AUTH-01 | 🟠 | Self-registration (`POST /api/auth/register`) removed. System is now closed: admin maintains `players.csv` (name, password, role). Server auto-loads roster on start; exits fatally if file missing. `POST /api/auth/register` returns 410. Coach role granted by CSV entry, not `COACH_PASSWORD` env var. `loginRosterPlayer(name)` replaces `registerPlayerAccount` in all callers. | Fixed 2026-03-17 |
| FE-15 | 🟠 | Coach received all opponent hole cards in `getPublicState()` during live play — leaked information during training. Now coach only sees all cards during non-branched replay and showdown, matching intended coaching flow. | Fixed 2026-03-17 |
| ISS-72 | 🔴 | `GameManager.js` `startGame()` did not mark players with `in_hand=false` as `is_active=false` — they were reset to `is_active=true` then only skipped for hole card dealing. The UTG calculation used a simple modulo index, so a sitting-out player could become `current_turn` on the first preflop action. Fixed by marking sitting-out players `is_active=false`/`action='sitting-out'` after the reset block, and replacing the UTG index with a loop that skips inactive players. Found via B201 batch. | Fixed 2026-03-16 |
| FE-12 | 🟠 | `PokerTable.jsx` — all players clustered on one side of the table. With sequential seat numbers (bots 0-2, coach 8), the raw POV-rotation formula mapped all bots to positions 6-7-8 (right side). Replaced `getSeatStyle(seatIndex)` with an even-distribution approach: players are sorted by seat, the viewer is placed at position 0, and the remaining seats are spread around the oval via a `POSITIONS_BY_COUNT` lookup (one entry per N = 1…9). D/SB/BB visual order and action turn order are correct as a result. | Fixed 2026-03-16 |
| FE-13 | 🟠 | `PokerTable.jsx` — hero seat card (position 0) rendered at `top: 92%` inside the flex-1 container, which placed it partially or fully behind the BettingControls bar. Changed to `top: 85%` so the card stays above the controls. Also raised position 1 (bottom-left) from 82 % → 80 % for consistency. | Fixed 2026-03-16 |
| FE-14 | 🟠 | `PokerTable.jsx` — BB / Chips toggle button was rendered inside the oval at `top-2 right-3`, overlapping the top-right player seat card and appearing as a persistent "CHIPS" label on that seat. Moved to `absolute top-3 left-3` outside the oval in the outer container. | Fixed 2026-03-16 |
| FE-15 | 🟠 | `GameManager.js` `getPublicState()` — `isCoach` unconditionally exposed all opponent hole cards to the coach socket, even during live play when the coach is a regular player. Coach now receives `HIDDEN` for opponents during live play and branched replay. All cards are revealed only during non-branched replay (`coachInReview`) and at showdown, which is the correct coaching-tool behaviour. | Fixed 2026-03-16 |
| FE-16 | 🟢 | `PlayerSeat.jsx` — opponent cards were rendered at 50 % opacity via an `isOpponentCard` wrapper div to hint they were coach-only previews. Now that the server sends `HIDDEN` for opponents in live play, the opacity hack is no longer needed (and was misleading in replay mode). Removed; added an explicit `card === 'HIDDEN'` guard that forces `hidden=true` regardless of local role. | Fixed 2026-03-16 |
| FEAT-05 | 🟢 | `server/index.js` — manually tagging a hand did not create a playlist. When `update_hand_tags` is received, each tag is now checked against existing playlist names for the table (case-insensitive). If no match exists a new playlist is auto-created with the tag as its name, and the hand is added. Existing matching playlists also receive the hand (idempotent via `INSERT OR IGNORE`). Updated `playlist_state` is emitted back to the coach. | Added 2026-03-16 |
| SB-01 | 🔴 | `server/db/HandLoggerSupabase.js` — coach stableId is `coach_<tableId>` (not a UUID). `upsertPlayerIdentity` and `recordAction` would throw FK/UUID errors if called for coaches. Fixed: skip both calls when `socket.data.isCoach` is true in `join_room` and `place_bet` handlers. | Fixed 2026-03-17 |
| SB-02 | 🔴 | `server/index.js` — `startHand` was fire-and-forget (`HandLogger.startHand(...).catch(...)`). Socket actions could arrive and call `recordAction` before the `hands` row existed in Supabase, causing FK violation. Fixed: `await HandLogger.startHand(...)` in both `start_game` and `start_configured_hand`. | Fixed 2026-03-17 |
| SB-03 | 🔴 | `server/db/HandLoggerSupabase.js` `endHand` — `state.winner` and `p.id` are socket.ids, not stableIds. `hand_players` rows were inserted with stableIds, so UPDATE matched zero rows; winner_id was a non-UUID string. Fixed: pass `socketToStable` map from index.js to `endHand`, use `resolveId()` helper throughout; UUID regex check before storing `winner_id`. | Fixed 2026-03-17 |
| SB-04 | 🟠 | `simulate_game.js` imported old SQLite `HandLogger` after Supabase migration — `loginRosterPlayer` called sync API against SQLite, stableIds from SQLite DB didn't exist in Supabase so `isRegisteredPlayer` rejected all players. Fixed: switched to `HandLoggerSupabase` + `await loginRosterPlayer`. | Fixed 2026-03-17 |
| SB-05 | 🟠 | `client/vite.config.js` had no `/api` proxy — login `fetch('/api/auth/login')` failed with "Network error" in dev mode. Fixed: added `/api` proxy target `http://localhost:3001`. | Fixed 2026-03-17 |
| SB-06 | 🟡 | `client/src/components/CoachSidebar.jsx` — `JSON.parse(h.auto_tags)` crashed when `auto_tags` is a native PostgreSQL array (returned as JS array by Supabase client). Fixed: wrapped with `Array.isArray` check — skips parse if already an array. | Fixed 2026-03-17 |
| SB-07 | 🟠 | All Supabase tables had RLS policies requiring `auth.uid()`. Anon client has no session in Phase 3 (pre-auth), so all `select` queries returned 500. Fixed: migration 003 adds `USING (true)` read policies on all 9 public tables. Temporary until Phase 1 (Auth) replaces them with user-scoped policies. | Fixed 2026-03-17 |
| CLEAN-01 | 🟡 | `server/db/Database.js` (SQLite schema, 169 lines), `server/db/HandLogger.js` (SQLite wrapper, 1043 lines), and `server/db/__tests__/HandLogger.test.js` (1155-line SQLite test suite) were dead code after the Supabase migration — still imported in simulate_batches.js and referenced in socket.integration.test.js. Deleted all three; updated simulate_batches.js to use HandLoggerSupabase (async); removed orphaned `jest.mock('../../db/Database')` block from socket.integration.test.js. Simulation .db files also deleted. | Fixed 2026-03-17 |
| FE-17 | 🟠 | `client/src/components/CoachSidebar.jsx` REPLAY CONTROLS section sat in the sidebar even though replay controls and betting controls never overlap. Moved to `client/src/components/PokerTable.jsx` — the replay panel now renders inline in the same slot as `BettingControls`, replacing it during non-branched replay. Sidebar no longer has a REPLAY CONTROLS section. | Fixed 2026-03-24 |
| FE-18 | 🟢 | `client/src/components/GhostSeat.jsx` rendered bare `<div>` placeholder rectangles when `holeCards.length !== 2` (e.g. abandoned or manual-mode hands). These were nearly invisible and gave no feedback. Now renders two `<Card hidden>` components (face-down blue backs) to clearly communicate "cards unknown". | Fixed 2026-03-24 |
| FE-19 | 🟢 | `client/src/components/PokerTable.jsx` / `BoardCards.jsx` — during `phase='replay'`, `isCoach=true` was passed to `BoardCards`, causing all 5 board slots to show interactive `+` buttons and the "click a slot to set card" hint, even though card injection is disabled during replay. Fixed by passing `isCoach={isCoach && phase !== 'replay'}`. | Fixed 2026-03-24 |
| FE-20 | 🟢 | `client/src/components/CoachSidebar.jsx` blind levels `<input type="number">` — React inline `style={{ appearance: 'textfield' }}` only suppresses spinners in Firefox. Chrome showed native spinner arrows that overflowed the panel border. Fixed: global CSS rule in `client/src/index.css` targeting `input[type='number']::-webkit-inner-spin-button` and `::-webkit-outer-spin-button`. Removed redundant per-component rule from `BettingControls.jsx`. | Fixed 2026-03-24 |
| FE-21 | 🟢 | `client/src/components/CoachSidebar.jsx` blind levels input — `type="number" min={2}` caused Chrome to reject intermediate keystrokes (e.g. typing "1" before "10"), making the field feel unresponsive. Also `flex-1` without `min-w-0` allowed the input to overflow its flex container. Fixed: changed to `type="text" inputMode="numeric"` with regex-strip onChange; added `min-w-0`. Same `min-w-0` fix applied to playlist name input and playlist select. | Fixed 2026-03-24 |
| SERVER-01 | 🟡 | `server/db/HandLoggerSupabase.js` `markIncomplete(handId)` only set `completed_normally=false`, leaving `board=[]` and `hole_cards=[]` in the DB for all hands abandoned at server shutdown. Replay of these hands showed empty board and placeholder cards. Fixed: `markIncomplete(handId, state?)` now optionally saves `board`, `final_pot`, `phase_ended`, and per-player `hole_cards`. `markAllHandsIncomplete()` in `server/index.js` now passes `gm.state`. | Fixed 2026-03-24 |
| ISS-74 | 🟠 | Coach sidebar (`position: fixed`) overlaid the table rather than pushing it. Rightmost seats were obscured when sidebar open. Fixed in UI Redesign: sidebar is now a flex sibling; oval centers via `paddingRight: sidebarOpen ? 360 : 0`; seats inside oval div reference oval dimensions. | Fixed 2026-03-24 |
| ISS-76 | 🟡 | `loginRosterPlayer` used `.ilike()` for the `display_name` lookup, which crashes on nondeterministic collations ("nondeterministic collations not supported for ILIKE", code 0A000). Fixed: switched to `.eq()` — the `display_name` column has `COLLATE case_insensitive` so equality is already case-insensitive. | Fixed 2026-03-24 |
| REFACTOR-01 | 🟡 | `server/index.js` was a 1704-line monolith mixing auth, socket handlers, game logic, REST routes, and DB calls with no separation of concerns. Extracted into: `server/auth/` (JwtService, requireAuth, requireRole, socketAuthMiddleware, socketGuards), `server/socket/` (middleware + 7 handler groups), `server/routes/` (6 route files), `server/game/` (BettingRound, ShowdownResolver, ReplayEngine), `server/db/repositories/` (5 repositories), `server/game/AnalyzerService.js`, `server/state/SharedState.js`, `server/lifecycle/`. Bootstrap reduced to ~110 lines. | Fixed 2026-03-25 (Phases 0–9) |
| REFACTOR-02 | 🟡 | `client/src/hooks/useSocket.js` was a single monolithic hook (all state + all socket listeners). Decomposed into 6 focused hooks: `useConnectionManager`, `useGameState`, `usePlaylistManager`, `useReplay`, `useNotifications`, `usePreferences`. `useSocket.js` becomes a 110-line composition layer. | Fixed 2026-03-25 (Phase 8) |
| REFACTOR-03 | 🟡 | `client/src/App.jsx` had 6 inline component definitions (514 lines total). Extracted: `ConnectionDot`, `JoinScreen`, `TopBar`, `TagHandPill`, `ErrorToast`, `NotificationToast` into `client/src/components/`. App.jsx reduced to 336 lines; emit bundle wrapped in `useMemo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders. | Fixed 2026-03-25 (Phase 8) |
| REFACTOR-04 | 🟡 | `client/src/components/CoachSidebar.jsx` was a 1626-line monolith with all coach UI, all state, and a duplicate `/api/hands` fetch on mount. Decomposed into 8 section components under `client/src/components/sidebar/`; `useHistory()` called once and shared via props. CoachSidebar.jsx reduced to 299 lines. | Fixed 2026-03-25 (Phase 8) |
| DB-10 | 🟡 | `PlayerRepository.getPlayerHands` sorted by `hand_id` (UUID, effectively random order). Hand history in the coach sidebar displayed in non-chronological order. Fixed: `.order('started_at', { foreignTable: 'hands', ascending: false })`. | Fixed 2026-03-25 (Phase 9) |
| DB-11 | 🟡 | `AnalyzerService.buildAnalyzerContext` used `SELECT *` on three tables, pulling unused columns and risking schema coupling. Replaced with explicit column lists on all three parallel queries. | Fixed 2026-03-25 (Phase 9) |
| SERVER-02 | 🟡 | `ALLOWED_ORIGIN` defaulted to `''` (empty string) when `CORS_ORIGIN` env var was not set, blocking all cross-origin browser requests in dev without a `.env` file. Fixed: defaults to `http://localhost:5173` when `NODE_ENV !== 'production'` and `CORS_ORIGIN` is unset. | Fixed 2026-03-25 (Phase 9) |
